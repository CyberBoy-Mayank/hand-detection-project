# hand-tracking-project

This project implements a real-time hand detection system using Python, leveraging MediaPipe's robust hand tracking solution and OpenCV for video capture and visualization. The system accurately identifies and tracks hand landmarks.

# Features

- **Hand Detection and Tracking**: Detects and tracks 21 hand landmarks in real-time.
- **Real-Time Performance**: Efficient processing ensures smooth and responsive hand tracking.

# Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/CyberBoy-Mayank/hand-tracking-project.git
    cd hand-tracking-project
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

# Usage

1. Run the hand main script:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

2. The script will start capturing video from your in-built webcam and display the detected hand landmarks in real-time.
